* * *

## Overview

![gameplay](/images/screenshot.png)

This is a simple Pygame-based ~alien shooter~ cat game that I made for Python/Pygame practice.  It's based on the tutorial from the excellent [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e/) book.

## Requirements:
- Python 3
- Pygame


To install Pygame, run:
```
$ python -m pip install --user pygame
```

If you need to specify Python3, then run:
```
$ python3 -m pip install --user pygame
```

> If this command doesn’t work on macOS, try running the command again without the `--user` flag.
