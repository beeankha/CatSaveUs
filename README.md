## Cat Save Us! 🛸 👾 🐈

* * *

### Overview

This is a simple Pygame-based ~alien~ cat shooter game that I did for Python practice.  It's based on the tutorial from the excellent [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e/) book.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3
- Pygame


To install Pygame, run:
```
$ python -m pip install --user pygame
```

If you need to specify Python3, then run:
```
$ python3 -m pip install --user pygame
```

> If this command doesn’t work on macOS, try running the command again without the `--user` flag.

## Running the Game

To run this game, navigate to the directory with the `alien_invasion.py` file and run:

```
python3 alien_invasion.py
```

Type `q` to quit out of the game.
